 Write to the DIVISOR operand of the divider, i.e. the q in `p / q`.  
 Any operand write starts a new calculation. The results appear in QUOTIENT, REMAINDER.  
 UDIVISOR/SDIVISOR are aliases of the same internal register. The U alias starts an  
 unsigned calculation, and the S alias starts a signed calculation.
