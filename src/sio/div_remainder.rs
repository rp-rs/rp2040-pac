 The result of `DIVIDEND % DIVISOR` (modulo). Contents undefined while CSR_READY is low.  
 For signed calculations, REMAINDER is negative only when DIVIDEND is negative.  
 This register can be written to directly, for context save/restore purposes. This halts any  
 in-progress calculation and sets the CSR_READY and CSR_DIRTY flags.  

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`div_remainder::R`](R).
